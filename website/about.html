                    <p class="quote">"I had dashboards full of data and no idea what to do with it."</p>

                    <p>After years working in fleet safety, the pattern was always the same. An incident would happen. We'd pull the data. And there it was &mdash; warning signs we should have seen. Patterns we should have caught. Red flags buried in spreadsheets that nobody had time to analyze.</p>

                    <p>The frustration wasn't the lack of information. We had <em>too much</em> information. Telematics platforms, ELD systems, dash cam events, inspection reports, fault codes &mdash; data was everywhere.</p>

                    <p>The frustration was the gap.</p>

                    <p><strong>The gap between having information and knowing what to do with it.</strong></p>

                    <p>We could track everything. But we couldn't act on anything &mdash; not proactively, not in a way that prevented the next incident instead of just documenting the last one.</p>

                    <p>SIE wasn't built in a Silicon Valley incubator. It was built at a kitchen table after midnight.</p>

                    <p>Every algorithm came from a real question I asked on the job:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><em>"Which driver is most likely to have an incident this week?"</em></li>
                        <li><em>"Is this fault code a real problem or just noise?"</em></li>
                        <li><em>"If DOT pulls us over tomorrow, are we ready?"</em></li>
                        <li><em>"Can I prove we did everything right?"</em></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The intelligence engines aren't theoretical. They're practical answers to questions safety professionals ask every day &mdash; questions I spent years asking without good answers.</p>
